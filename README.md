# Hey, Iâ€™m Sami ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a rising CS senior at Brown University driven by a simple philosophy: **use AI for human good**. This has led me to focus on two areas:
1. **Aligned AI and Safety** â€“ researching how to make large models fair, interpretable, and trustworthy
2. **Scalable, Impactful Applications** â€“ building software that delivers drastic improvements, like my work at Amazon creating multiâ€‘agent AI systems to cut issue resolution time by 40+%

- **Experience**: Software development, deep learning (PyTorch, TensorFlow), LLMs (Agentic AI, Prompt Engineering, LangChain)
- **Currently**: Researching interpretability and designing AIâ€‘driven engineering systems in industry
